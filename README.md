## Features

- Remove image attachment files and their referencing links
- When the same image is referenced twice or more, a popup window will appear and it will not be deleted directly to avoid the image being deleted by mistake. pop-up window with the current reference to the image of the document and other documents referencing the image of the document path information, the bottom `close` button and `remove link` button, click `remove link` button can continue to remove **current document** in the image reference link.
  - Case 1: the same document is referenced multiple times in a single document
  - Case 2: the same image is referenced in multiple documents at the same time
- Support markdown and wiki link style links
- Support for three different formats of **Internal link types** ([details](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links))
  - The shortest possible form
  - Relative path based on the current notes
  - Absolute path based on the repository root directory
- Supported image types: `jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg, bmp`
- Support for setting how to handle images after deletion: ‚ë† Move to system recycle bin; ‚ë° Move to obsidian trash; ‚ë¢ Delete permanently

> üòÖA small problem: If the image is in a callout block, the delete button may not be displayed directly. To do so, you can manually press the `blank space` button on your keyboard elsewhere in the document.

> üòÅ This plugin theoretically supports the deletion of any type of attachment file, but I don't need it, so for now it only supports image type files
